# Game Service (Redis)

Service layer that provides persistence and concurrency control for multiplayer Rummikub games using Redis as the backend.

## Overview

The service layer acts as a bridge between the stateless game engine and persistent storage, providing:
- Game state persistence and retrieval
- Concurrency control for multiplayer games
- Game lifecycle management

## Redis Schema

### Key Naming Conventions

Simple key structure for storing game states:

```
rummikub:games:{game_id}                    # Game state (JSON)
rummikub:games:{game_id}:lock               # Game-level lock (STRING)
```

### Data Structures

#### 1. Game State (`rummikub:games:{game_id}`)
**Type**: JSON  
**TTL**: 24 hours for completed games, no expiry for active games  
**Content**: Serialized `GameState` object

```json
{
  "game_id": "uuid-string",
  "players": [
    {
      "id": "player-uuid",
      "name": "Player Name",
      "initial_meld_met": false,
      "rack": {
        "tile_ids": ["tile-uuid-1", "tile-uuid-2", ...]
      }
    }
  ],
  "current_player_index": 0,
  "pool": {
    "tile_ids": ["tile-uuid-x", "tile-uuid-y", ...]
  },
  "board": {
    "melds": [
      {
        "id": "meld-uuid",
        "kind": "GROUP",
        "tiles": ["tile-uuid-a", "tile-uuid-b", "tile-uuid-c"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T12:30:00Z",
  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
  "winner_player_id": null,
  "num_players": 4
}
```

#### 2. Game Lock (`rummikub:games:{game_id}:lock`)
**Type**: STRING  
**TTL**: 5 seconds (auto-release on timeout)  
**Content**: Session ID of lock holder

Used for exclusive locking during game state updates.

## Concurrency Model

### Simple Locking Strategy

The service uses a simple lock-read-action-save-unlock pattern to handle concurrent game state modifications:

1. **Lock**: Acquire exclusive lock on game
2. **Read**: Read current game state from Redis
3. **Action**: Apply game engine operations
4. **Save**: Write updated game state to Redis
5. **Unlock**: Release the exclusive lock

If a lock is already held, the operation waits for the lock to be released.

### Lock Implementation

```python
async def acquire_game_lock(game_id: str, session_id: str) -> bool:
    """Acquire exclusive lock on game for updates. Blocks until available."""
    lock_key = f"rummikub:games:{game_id}:lock"
    while True:
        acquired = await redis.set(lock_key, session_id, nx=True, ex=5)
        if acquired:
            return True
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Wait before retry

async def release_game_lock(game_id: str, session_id: str) -> bool:
    """Release lock if owned by session."""
    lock_key = f"rummikub:games:{game_id}:lock"
    lua_script = """
    if redis.call("GET", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then
        return redis.call("DEL", KEYS[1])
    else
        return 0
    end
    """
    return await redis.eval(lua_script, [lock_key], [session_id])
```

### Conflict Resolution

- **Lock contention**: Operations wait for lock release with automatic retry
- **Lock timeouts**: Very short TTL (5 seconds) ensures quick recovery from failures
- **Network failures**: Automatic lock cleanup prevents deadlocks

## Service API Contracts

### Core Service Interface

```python
@dataclass
class GameService:
    """Main service interface for game management."""
    
    # Game Lifecycle
    async def create_game(self, num_players: int) -> GameState:
        """Create new game and return state."""
    
    async def join_game(self, game_id: str, player_name: str) -> GameState:
        """Join game by game ID."""
    
    async def get_game(self, game_id: str) -> GameState | None:
        """Retrieve current game state."""
    
    async def start_game(self, game_id: str) -> GameState:
        """Start game if all players joined."""
    
    # Game Actions
    async def execute_turn(self, game_id: str, player_id: str, action: Action) -> GameState:
        """Execute player action (play tiles or draw)."""
    
    async def get_current_player(self, game_id: str) -> str:
        """Get ID of player whose turn it is."""
```

### Exception Mapping

Service-specific exceptions that wrap domain exceptions:

```python
class ServiceError(Exception):
    """Base service layer exception."""

class GameNotFoundError(ServiceError):
    """Game ID not found in Redis."""

class ConcurrentModificationError(ServiceError):
    """Game modified by another player."""
```

## Game Management Flows

### Game Creation Flow

1. Service creates game via engine â†’ `GameState`
2. Service persists game state to Redis with game_id as key
3. Return `GameState`

### Join Game Flow

1. Player provides game_id + display name
2. Service retrieves game state
3. Service validates game accepts more players
4. Service updates game via engine (`join_game`)
5. Service persists updated game state
6. Return updated `GameState`

### Turn Execution Flow

1. Acquire game lock
2. Retrieve current game state
3. Validate it's player's turn
4. Execute action via engine
5. Persist updated game state
6. Release game lock
7. Return updated `GameState`

## Persistence Strategy

### Data Consistency

- **Atomicity**: Use Redis transactions for multi-key updates
- **Durability**: Configure Redis persistence (AOF + RDB)
- **Lock safety**: Short TTL prevents deadlocks

### Memory Management

- **TTL Policy**: Completed games expire after 24 hours
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of expired games

## Implementation Notes

- **DI-Friendly**: Service accepts Redis client interface for testing
- **Async/Await**: All operations are async for high concurrency
- **Type Safety**: Full type annotations with proper generics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy
- **Testing**: Use `fakeredis` for unit tests, real Redis for integration
- **Configuration**: Environment-based Redis connection settings
